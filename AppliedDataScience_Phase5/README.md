# Assessment of Marginal Workers in Tamil Nadu README

This Jupyter Notebook is dedicated to the analysis of demographic characteristics of marginal workers in Tamil Nadu using data from the 2011 Indian Census. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and data visualization. Below are the steps to run this code:

## Prerequisites
1. You need to have Python installed on your system.
2. Install Jupyter Notebook and the required libraries using pip:
   pip install jupyter numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
   

## Steps to Run the Code
1. Clone or download the Jupyter Notebook file and the dataset ('marginal_workers_data.csv') to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the Jupyter Notebook and the dataset.
3. Start a Jupyter Notebook session:
   jupyter notebook
4. In the Jupyter Notebook dashboard, open the 'Marginal_Workers_Analysis.ipynb' file.
5. Run the code cells in the notebook sequentially by clicking on each cell and pressing Shift + Enter.
6. You can interact with the code, view visualizations, and explore demographic insights as the code executes.

## Dataset Used
For this analysis, we used a dataset titled 'Marginal Workers Classified by Age, Industrial Category, and Sex - Census 2011.' The dataset contains valuable information about marginal workers in Tamil Nadu, focusing on their age, industrial category, and gender. It was sourced from the following URL: [Marginal Workers Dataset](https://tn.data.gov.in/catalog/marginal-workers-classified-age-industrial-category-and-sex-census-2011-india-and-states).

## About the Dataset
The dataset provides a comprehensive view of marginal workers in Tamil Nadu. Marginal workers are those employed for less than six months in a year and often face unique socioeconomic challenges. The dataset contains the following key attributes:
- Age
- Industrial category
- Gender
- Location (if available)
- Other demographic details

By analyzing this dataset, we aim to gain insights into the demographic characteristics of marginal workers in Tamil Nadu. The analysis focuses on their age distribution, industry preferences, gender disparities, and geographic distribution within the region.

## Understanding the Code
The code in the Jupyter Notebook includes the following sections:
- Importing necessary libraries and reading the dataset.
- Data preprocessing, cleaning, and feature engineering.
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations.
- Building insightful visualizations using techniques such as bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps.
- Interpretation of demographic insights for policymaking and targeted interventions.

Feel free to explore and adapt the code to gain a deeper understanding of the demographic characteristics of marginal workers in Tamil Nadu using this rich dataset.
